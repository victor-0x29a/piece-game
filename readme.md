  Piece Game
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center">A gambling game based on computer components (pieces).</h4>


## Purpose

Create a back-end with CRUD operations for users and known computer components. After that, allow users to place bets on which component will be drawn. If the user's chosen components match the ones drawn by the server, they would theoretically "win" those components.
* It's worth mentioning that before that, there would be a credit system in place to enable placing bets!

## Implementations

* For the credit system, I will integrate the PagBank sandbox API to generate PIX QR codes and simulate payments.
